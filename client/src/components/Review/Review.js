        <h5>🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟</h5>
          <p>We stayed in the family room and the Oval room at The Rocky Cove B&B in Ilfracombe North Devon and the accommodation was excellent and the service and the breakfast was 10 out of 10. You are served complimentary homemade fudge along with the teas and coffees in the room which was delightful and a beautiful surprise. The hosts Nicki and Jonah were excellent. We will be coming back to stay again. Thank you</p>

          <p>Ive booked several trips through Travelapp, without a problem. Last weekend, I booked a flight on a Saturday with their 24 hour no charge cancellation. Monday morning I found I needed to change the dates of the flight. AA wouldnt waive the $200. change fee, on the non refundable flight. I called Travelapp, explained my problem, and the rebooked my flight, with full refund! They explained the 24 hour policy meant business work days, so Sunday didnt count. I wrote recommendation for Travelapp on all my social media, after that! So great to find a company worthy of a positive review! Thank you, Travelapp!</p>
